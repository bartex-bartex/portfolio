Developed the backend of a WebAPI service that supports formatting and linting for a custom file format that combines Markdown and KaTeX. The service includes dedicated formatters and linters for various languages such as Markdown, LaTeX, C++, C, SQL, and Python. The frontend team implemented a text editor with auto-linting, on-demand formatting, and a rendered output window for a seamless user experience.
