Developed a 2D game for a high school competition as part of a two-person team. I was responsible for programming, while my teammate handled graphic design. The game follows the story of a time traveler trapped in time, where the player must solve a series of physics-based puzzles to escape. The plot includes an unexpected twist at the end, adding depth and intrigue to the narrative.
